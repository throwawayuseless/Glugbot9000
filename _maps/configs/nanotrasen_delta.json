	"description": "The Delta is a compact and advanced mining ship that supplements its comparatively small organic crew with a full suite of robotics facilities, including an AI and a host of mining and logistics drones and cyborgs. The Delta's low logistical footprint has thoroughly endeared it to N+S Logistics' upper management, but its cramped accomodations and lackluster defensive armament make it distinctly unpopular with the company's spacefaring employees.",
